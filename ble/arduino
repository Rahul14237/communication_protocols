1. Import <ArduinoBLE.h>
2. Create required service and characteristics using "BLEService" and "BLEByteCharacteristic" classes
     syntax: className service/char name(input argumnets as per constructor)
3. Under setup() do:
    a.  Initialize BLE peripheral using "begin" function of "BLE" class
    b.  Set service and characteristic:
         i. Set the advertised service using "setAdvertisedService" function of BLE class
         ii. Add characteristic in the service set earlier using "addCharacteristic" function of "BLEService" class
         iii. Add service using "addService" function of "BLE" class
4. Under loop() do:
    a. Check if central is discoverable using "Central" function of BLE
    b. if central is connected then continously update the charceteristic value using "Value" function
