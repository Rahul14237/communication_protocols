1. The Generic Access Profile (GAP) controls the RF state of the device, with the device in one of five states:
    - Standby
    - Advertising
    - Scanning
    - Initiating
    - Connected

    Advertisers(A) transmit data without connecting, while scanners(B) scan for advertisers. 
    An initiator(B) is a device that responds to an advertiser(A) with a request to connect. 
    If the advertiser(A) accepts the connection request, both the advertiser(A) and initiator(B) enter a connected state. 
    When a device is connected, it connects as either master or slave. Scanners become master(B) and advertisers become slave(A).
    The device(B) initiating the connection becomes the master(B) and the device(A) accepting the request becomes the slave(A).
    
2. Layers of BLE: fig 1
    - GATT: The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) layer is a service framework that defines the sub-procedures for using ATT. 
            Data communications that occur between two devices in a Bluetooth low energy connection are handled through GATT sub-procedures. 
            The application and/or profiles will directly use GATT.
